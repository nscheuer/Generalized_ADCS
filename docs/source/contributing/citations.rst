Citations
=========

This page tracks source literature behind package-level algorithms, estimator
formulations, environmental models, and reusable technical methods. Each entry
links to the relevant package documentation, gives the original citation, and
links to the original paper.

Satellite and component data sources for preset factories are listed on the
Satellite Factory pages next to the affected spacecraft or hardware rows. Keep
factory-only data sources there so large preset tables remain traceable without
turning this page into a duplicate bibliography.

When adding a new paper-derived algorithm or reusable model, include the
documentation page where the model is described and cite the source used for the
equations, assumptions, or parameter values.

Estimators
----------

Estimator citations should be added here when an estimator implementation is
derived from a specific paper or validated against a published formulation.
